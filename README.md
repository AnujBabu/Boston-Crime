# Boston-Crime

I have used data visualisation libraries like pandas, matplotlib and seanborn.
In this project I visualised all the crimes that are being done in Boston City  data given from kaggle.com
I took the data and visualise all the primes that are happening in a particular amount of time like at what time the most of the crimes are happening. For the specific types of crimes that are being done at the night time and what are the specific type of crimes that are being at the mid day.  I also visualised at what latitude and longitude of Boston City and the most of the crimes are being happened
After the visualisation I plotted all of my conclusion in graphs using matplotlib and seanborn library.
